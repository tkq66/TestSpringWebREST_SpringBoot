/*
 * The Spring Boot gradle plugin provides many convenient features:
 *
 * 1. It collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single, runnable "über-jar", 
 * which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.
 *
 * 2. It searches for the public static void main() method to flag as a runnable class.
 *
 * 3. It provides a built-in dependency resolver that sets the version number to match 
 * Spring Boot dependencies. You can override any version you wish, but it will default 
 * to Boot’s chosen set of versions.
